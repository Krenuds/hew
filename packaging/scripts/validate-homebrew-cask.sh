# local tap, runs brew's style and audit checks, installs it (the .dmg
# download and checksum, the app, and the hew-cli link), confirms the linked
# CLI reports the release's version, and uninstalls it again with --zap, so a
# wrong digest, a moved sidecar, or a zap list that reaches past the app's own
# state fails loudly here instead of on a user's machine. Runs on a macOS

# HOME), so it never touches the real one. On a machine that already has Hew
# in /Applications, point the install somewhere else with
# HOMEBREW_CASK_OPTS=--appdir=<dir>, and quit Hew first: the cask's uninstall
# stanza quits the app by bundle identifier.
