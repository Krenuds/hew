Tool shortcuts are plain letters, the same on every platform, matching SketchUp's defaults wherever SketchUp has one. Command shortcuts use `⌘` on macOS and `Ctrl` on Windows, Linux, and the web.

## Tools

| Tool | Key |
|---|---|
| Select | `Space` |
| Line | `L` |
| Rectangle | `R` |
| Circle | `C` |
| Polygon | — |
| Arc | `A` |
| Push/Pull | `P` |
| Offset | `F` |
| Move | `M` |
| Rotate | `Q` |
| Scale | `S` |
| Tape Measure | `T` |
| Paint | `B` |
| Orbit | `O` |
| Pan | `H` |
| Zoom | `Z` |

Polygon, Protractor, Slice, Section Plane, and Edit Vertex have no default key, same as in SketchUp — reach them via the Draw/Tools menu or the command palette. On macOS the menus also display `⌘`-combination accelerators beside the tools; those work too, but the letters above are the ones worth learning.

## During a gesture

These keys change what the *current tool operation* does. Each is covered in more depth in its tool's own chapter:

| Key | Effect |
|---|---|
| `Esc` | Cancel / step back the current gesture; or exit one editing-context level |
| `Enter` | Commit the typed value |
| Type a number/length | Exact value for the current gesture (no input box needed) — also works right after a commit, redoing what you just made at the new value (every draw tool and Push/Pull, Offset, Move, Rotate, Scale) |
| `Shift` | Lock to the dominant axis (Line, Move, Tape Measure) · lock the axis/plane (Rotate, Protractor, Slice) · pan while orbiting (Orbit tool; can be pressed or released mid-drag, switching orbit and pan back and forth) |
| `→` / `←` / `↑` | Lock to the X / Y / Z axis (Line, Move, Rotate, Protractor, Slice, Tape Measure); `↓` clears |
| `⌘`/`Ctrl` (held) | Measure without dropping a guide (Tape Measure) · turn off inertia for a precise, 1:1 orbit or pan (Orbit/Pan tools and middle-button orbit); pressing it while the camera is still coasting stops it dead |
| `Option` (Mac) / `Ctrl` (Windows, Linux) (tap) | Move/Rotate toggles between moving/rotating and copying (stays on until tapped again) |
| `Option`/`Alt` (press) | Arc cycles how the arc closes: open · pie · segment |
| `3x` or `3/` + `Enter` | Right after a copy commits: multiply it into 3 copies / divide the distance into 3 (Move; `x3` and `/3` work too) |
| `Shift`-click | Toggle each clicked object in the selection (Select tool); same for a Shift-drag marquee |
| `⌘`/`Option`-click (Mac) · `Ctrl`/`Alt`-click (Windows, Linux) | Add to the selection, never removing (Select tool); same for a marquee drag. On a Mac, `Ctrl`-click is a right-click, so use `⌘` or `Option` there |
| `Shift` + `⌘`/`Option`-click (Mac) · `Shift` + `Ctrl`/`Alt`-click (Windows, Linux) | Subtract from the selection, never adding (Select tool); same for a marquee drag |
| Triple-click | Select a line's whole connected shape (Select tool) |
| `⌘`/`Ctrl`-click | Paint the whole object instead of one face (Paint tool) |
| Double-click | Enter a group/component/object's editing context; end a Line chain |
| `Delete` / `Backspace` | Delete the selection (any tool) |

## Mouse

| Action | Input |
|---|---|
| Orbit | Middle-button drag (hold `⌘`/`Ctrl` to turn off inertia for a precise orbit) |
| Pan | Right-button drag |
| Zoom (to cursor) | Scroll wheel |
