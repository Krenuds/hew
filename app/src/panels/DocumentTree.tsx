/**
 * DocumentTree — the document outliner ( navigation).

 * recursive, with expand/collapse for groups) followed by free-standing
 * sketches as ordinary rows in the same list. Breadcrumb shows the combined
 * path: Model → open session frames (outermost first) → object context
 * (docs/design/group-session.md).
 *
 * Click to select; double-click to enter context. Structural actions
 * (booleans, group/ungroup, component ops) live in the menus/dock — this
 * panel is purely navigational plus visibility (the eye toggles) and a text
 * filter. Node types are distinguished by small stroke-based inline SVG

  //     a frame with no live members yet, and sits directly above its
  //     members, so revealing it brings the members into view too; a
  //     first-member target would need special-casing an empty frame.
  //   - shrink (close): tagged `node:<nodeKey>` and matched against the
  //     closed frame's own node once it reappears as an ordinary row — a
  //     `topNodes` entry, or a member of whichever frame is now innermost.
  //     Either way it renders unconditionally, never behind a COLLAPSED
  //     plain group's expand toggle: every node a session can be opened on
  //     got there with its whole ancestor chain already open, either as
