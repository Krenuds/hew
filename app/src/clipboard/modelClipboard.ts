/**
 * modelClipboard — in-memory clipboard for Copy/Cut/Paste/Paste In Place of
 * structural selections (docs/design/v1.1-cycle.md Lane D).
 *
 * Content is `Scene::extract_item` bytes of the copied selection —
 * `wrap_as_component: false`, deliberately NOT Save to Library's wrap, so a
 * pasted plain box stays a plain box rather than becoming an instance of a
 * freshly-minted one-off component. `insert_item` (the paste side) is the
 * same lossless graft Library placement uses, provenance-stamped with a
 * `sourceId`/`contentHash` derived from the bytes themselves so repeated
 * pastes of the SAME copy reuse whatever definitions the first paste
 * created rather than minting duplicates.
 *
 * Held at module scope (survives tool switches/re-renders within one tab).
 * Under Tauri, also mirrored into the Rust app-state clipboard
 * (`clipboard_set`/`clipboard_get`, shared across every open document
 * window) so a copy in one window pastes in another — `refreshFromShell`
 * pulls the shared state in whenever this window regains focus, treating
 * the shell as the cross-window source of truth at that moment while
 * leaving the richer same-window copy (`count`/`kinds`) alone when it's
 * still the freshest thing around (bytes-equal check). On the web build
 * there is no cross-tab channel — the clipboard is per-tab only, a stated
 * limitation, not a gap to close.

   * the source selection, or the source selection resolved to no visible
   * content). Read from `Scene.extract_item_placement` at Copy time
   * (App.tsx's `doCopy`), since Paste In Place has no access to the
   * ORIGINAL selection by the time it runs — the kernel computes this,
   * never re-derived here, because it depends on internal `extract_item`
   * behavior a JS-side approximation could silently drift from:
   * `Document::extract_item` re-origins an item's content to its VISIBLE
   * bottom-center whenever the drawing axes are identity (the
   * overwhelmingly common case — see that function's "Re-origin" doc
   * comment), in which case this is a pure translation by that point; when
   * the axes are moved, `extract_item` does NOT re-origin (the deliberately
   * placed frame IS the chosen insertion point) and this is instead the
   * axes frame's own forward transform — a bare identity affine would
   * reproduce the original position in NEITHER case.
