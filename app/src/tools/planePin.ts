/**
 * planePin — the Shift-pinned drawing plane the draw tools (Line/Rectangle/
 * Circle/Polygon/Arc) share (GitHub issue 14; the Getting Started guide's
 * "hover over a face that is already on your intended plane and press
 * Shift to lock the cursor into that plane").
 *
 * While a draw tool is IDLE, every pointer move records the plane the next
 * click would land on — the hovered eligible face's plane, a hovered
 * sketch's plane, or the ground (`trackHover`). A Shift press pins that
 * plane: the tool's snap query is constrained to it, the first click
 * anchors a PLANE-mode gesture on it, and the cursor stays on it wherever
 * it goes — off the face's edge, over the ground, over another solid.
 * Pressing Shift again, or Escape while idle, releases the pin. The pin
 * survives a completed gesture (draw several shapes on one plane) exactly
 * like the arrow-key idle plane lock does, and `cancel()` — a tool switch,
 * a document reset — drops it.
 *
 * Toggle, not hold: the same convention as Rotate/Protractor/Slice ("press
 * Shift again to release"), and the only one that works for a two-click
 * gesture the user cannot keep a modifier held through comfortably.
 * `setShiftHeld(true)` arrives on every keydown AUTOREPEAT while Shift is
 * held, so the toggle fires once per physical press: a repeat while the key
 * is still down is ignored, and the release re-arms it.
 *
 * The pinned plane is a fixed plane in space, not an axis through the
 * click (the arrow-key lock's shape), so the two are mutually exclusive:
 * pinning clears an arrow lock and an arrow lock clears the pin — the tool
 * owns that pairing, this class only owns the pin.
