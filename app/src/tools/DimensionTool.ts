/**
 * DimensionTool — SketchUp-style linear + radial dimensions
 * (docs/design/dimensions-text.md "Tools & UX", with the gesture-plane and
 * radial-disambiguation fixes from docs/design/dimensions-playtest2.md §3/§4
 * layered on top — see those sections for the "why"). Kernel entity:
 * `Annotation::LinearDimension` / `Annotation::RadialDimension`
 * (crates/kernel/src/annotation.rs); rendered by
 * `SceneRenderer.refreshAnnotations()`.
 *
 * Gesture (linear — SketchUp's real dimension gesture, three presses):
 *   1. First click: picks anchor A (any inference snap point). Live rubber-
 *      band from A to the cursor previews the baseline.
 *   2. Second click: picks anchor B. A hovered sketch's plane is adopted at
 *      the FIRST click (sketches on any plane — mirrors `TapeMeasureTool`'s
 *      hover-adopted non-ground sketch plane), unless an arrow-key plane
 *      lock is active (a lock beats adoption, the draw tools' own rule).
 *   3. Pointer move drags the dimension line's perpendicular OFFSET out of
 *      the A-B line (SketchUp's "drag out" gesture). The plane the offset
 *      drags in — the dimension's WORKING plane — is always MODEL-anchored
 *      (the angle-dimensions fix; annotationLayout.ts §3 documents why the
 *      earlier screen-parallel "view-facing" rule was itself the defect),
 *      in priority order:
 *        a. the arrow-key-locked plane through the baseline
 *           (`lockedDimensionPlaneNormal`; same arrow → plane-normal-axis
 *           convention as the draw tools — ArrowRight/Left = the red/green
 *           upright planes, ArrowUp = the blue flat plane, same arrow
 *           again or ArrowDown unlocks);
 *        b. the sketch plane adopted at the first click;
 *        c. the best AXIS-ALIGNED plane through the baseline for where the
 *           cursor ray lands (`axisDimensionPlane`) — never the ground
 *           plane, and never a camera-anchored free plane. From a pose
 *           looking PERPENDICULAR to the baseline the candidate planes
 *           project onto the same screen strip and the drag cannot say
 *           which is meant (annotationLayout.ts §3's AMBIGUOUS-POSES
 *           note): the most face-on plane wins deliberately, and the
 *           arrow lock is the way to choose the other one.
 *      Live preview shows extension lines, the dimension line, arrowheads,
 *      and the live `formatLength` readout.
 *   4. Third click commits: `add_linear_dimension(a, b, offset, plane)`.
 *      Degenerate (cursor still on the A-B line, zero offset) refuses with a
 *      status hint rather than committing an unplaceable dimension.
 *
 * Gesture (radial — click a drawn circle/arc, dimensions-playtest2.md §4):
 *   1. First click on a drawn (unextruded) sketch circle/arc's rim OR its
 *      analytic center snap starts a PENDING `'have-curve'` stage — it does
 *      NOT commit to a radial dimension yet (the old bug: entering "radial
 *      mode" on the first click meant the second click could only ever
 *      supply a leader direction, never a real second measurement point).
 *   2. Pointer move live-previews whatever the SECOND click would currently
 *      produce (`_classify`) — a plain leader (radius/diameter, drawn
 *      center-to-rim or rim-to-rim per `buildRadialGeometry`) while
 *      hovering free space, or an ordinary linear-dimension preview while
 *      hovering another point on the same rim.
 *   3. Tab toggles the DEFAULT radius/diameter preference while pending
 *      (only takes effect if the eventual second click lands off the curve
 *      entirely — an explicit center/antipodal click always wins with its
 *      own definite kind).
 *   4. Second click decides, per the disambiguation table:
 *      off the curve (free space)  -> radial dimension, default kind Radius
 *        for an arc / Diameter for a full circle (SketchUp's rule),
 *        overridable by Tab.
 *      the curve's centre           -> Radius, anchored at the FIRST click's
 *        rim point (or, reversed — centre first, rim second — the SECOND
 *        click's rim point).
 *      an antipodal rim point       -> Diameter (the chord passes within
 *        `chordPassesNearCentre`'s tolerance of the centre).
 *      any other rim point          -> an ordinary LINEAR dimension of that
 *        chord (transitions to `'have-b'`, same drag-offset-then-click as
 *        any other linear dimension).
 *      anything else identifiable   -> an ordinary linear dimension to it.
 *
 * A drawn sketch curve is not a document tree node (`NodeId` is
 * Object/Group/Instance only — sketches aren't), so a radial dimension's
 * anchor is always a FREE anchor (`node: None`): it is captured exact at
 * creation but will not geometrically re-anchor if the source sketch is
 * later edited. This is an inherent limit of D1's `Anchor` model (matching
 * the design doc's own scope — sketches were never part of the anchor node
 * space), not something this tool works around.
 *
 * Esc cancels the current stage; a fresh click always starts over.

   *      `lockedDimensionPlaneNormal` instead, which this method has no
   *      baseline yet to compute.
   *   2. The first click's own snap landing `on-face` on a real object
   *      face (never a sketch-region fill, which reports `elementKind ===
   *      'sketch-region'` instead of `'face'`): that face's plane, through
   *      `aPoint`.

   *      height; Front → the XZ plane; ISO → whichever axis wins) — `null`

   * adopted-plane case, where the snap system already constrains the cursor
   * to the plane and the snapped cursor should be used as-is.
   *
   * Returns `null` (no working plane — the offset falls back to the raw
   * snapped cursor) when the baseline is degenerate, or when neither a
   * usable lock nor an adopted plane exists and either no camera has been
   * registered (callers that never wire one in — every legacy unit test —
   * keep the exact pre-camera behavior) or the ray pierces no candidate
   * plane at all (e.g. sighting straight down the baseline).
