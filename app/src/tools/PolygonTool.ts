/**
 * PolygonTool — two-click regular N-gon sketching, center then circumradius.
 *
 * A regular polygon's N sides ARE its geometry — unlike CircleTool's faceted
 * circle, there is no "true polygon" underneath that the edges approximate.
 * But a polygon still HAS a center: the user placed one, and dragged a
 * circumradius from it. Plane mode therefore commits N chained
 * `sketch_add_segment` calls inside a POLYGON curve bracket
 * (`sketch_begin_polygon_with`), which records exactly that center and
 * radius. The chain then selects and deletes as one unit and offers its
 * center to inference the way a circle's does — while the kernel's
 * `SketchCurveKind::Polygon` keeps the circumcircle from being mistaken for
 * a curve: no quadrant or tangent snaps on points lying on no edge, no
 * concentric-arc offset, no cylindrical wall swept on extrusion.
 *
 * Face mode still imprints with one plain `split_face_inner` call and N loop
 * points, carrying no analytic identity onto the solid — the same posture it
 * has always had, and the same one CircleTool's `split_face_inner_with_curve`
 * deliberately departs from for a real curve.
 *
 * Two modes:
 *
 * Mode is decided by what's under the cursor per pointer event (mirrors
 * LineTool/CircleTool; see `faceDraw.ts` for the shared plain-object
 * eligibility policy), never by `_activeContext` alone.
 *
 * Plane mode (no eligible face under the cursor — sketches on any plane,
 * design doc §1/§4, same as every other draw tool): the drawing plane is
 * resolved once, at the FIRST click, and frozen for the rest of the gesture:
 *   - A top-level hover over a committed sketch whose plane is non-ground
 *     (`pick_sketch` + `planeFromSketch`) adopts THAT sketch's plane —
 *     SKETCH MODE — and every edge lands in that one sketch
 *     (`SketchTarget.existing`).
 *   - Otherwise the plane is the ground plane — PLANE MODE, today's
 *     behavior — segments land in the shared per-plane cached sketch
 *     (`SketchTarget.plane`; `begin_ground_sketch()` on a cache miss).
 *   On the ground plane the center/rim/facets are computed by the EXACT
 *   legacy `circlePolygonGround` (z = 0, no basis math) — bit-identical
 *   committed coordinates. On any other plane, facets come from
 *   `circlePolygonFace` (the same helper face mode uses), and the cursor is
 *   the snap (already plane-constrained via `snapConstraint`) or, absent
 *   one, ray∩plane.
 *
 *   1. First click: anchor center (snapped on the resolved plane)
 *   2. Move: rubber-band N-gon preview whose first vertex passes through the
 *      cursor (circumradius = distance from center to cursor; start angle =
 *      angle from center to cursor)
 *   3. Second click: commit — N sketch_add_segment calls chaining
 *      vertex[i] -> vertex[i+1], last one vertex[N-1] -> vertex[0] (using
 *      the SAME stored vertex[0] coords for exact closure), via
 *      `runSketchGesture`
 *   4. Esc between clicks: cancel stage 1
 *   Calls onCommit() after each successful commit so the viewport can
 *   refresh scene geometry and trigger re-render.
 *
 * With a draw tool idle, an arrow key locks the next gesture's drawing plane
 * by its normal (design §5.2, same mechanism as every other draw tool) — see
 * `_resolveClickTarget`/`activeDrawPlaneCue`.
 *
 * Face mode (an eligible Object face is under the cursor):
 *   1. First click on an eligible face: anchor center (on face plane)
 *   2. Move: rubber-band N-gon preview projected onto that face plane
 *   3. Second click: commit — split_face_inner() on that face with N loop
 *      points
 *   4. Esc: cancel
 *   Calls onFaceImprint(objectId) after each successful imprint so the
 *   viewport can refresh the scene.
 *
 * Sides: default 6, changed at any time during the gesture by typing `<n>s`
 * (SketchUp's Polygon convention, e.g. `8s`) and Enter — clamped to
 * [MIN_POLYGON_SIDES, MAX_POLYGON_SIDES], stays anchored (does not commit),
 * and refreshes the live preview immediately from the last known cursor. The
 * side count persists across gestures (an instance field), and across tool
 * re-selection via `setSideCount`/`OnSideCountChange` — the Viewport wires
 * these to a session-lived value the same way PaintTool's current material
 * persists.
 *
 * VCB: the circumradius is a SINGLE length (unlike Rectangle's W x D), so
 * typed entry mirrors CircleTool's single-length VCB style
 * (editPolygonBuffer/parseLengthToMeters) — extended with the `<n>s`
 * side-count grammar (editPolygonBuffer/parsePolygonSideCount).
