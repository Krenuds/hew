 *
 *  For two unit vectors, `|cross|` ≈ sin(θ) between them, so this doubles
 *  as an angular tolerance: 1e-2 ≈ 0.57° (small-angle approximation, θ ≈
 *  sin θ near 0). That headroom matters, not just the exact zero case —
 *  `prevDir`/`segDir` reaching this branch is EXACTLY parallel only when a
 *  chain literally continues straight ahead with no floating-point noise
 *  anywhere in the pipeline; in practice they arrive with a small residual
 *  angle from ordinary inference/projection imprecision. A too-tight
 *  epsilon (formerly 1e-6, θ ≈ 0.00006° — tighter than any real pointer
 *  input ever lands) can't tell that "genuinely meant to be parallel, plus
 *  noise" case apart from an actual small-angle turn, so it almost always
 *  takes the OTHER branch (spans `prevDir` × `segDir`) instead of the
 *  intended parallel fallback. That branch is numerically ill-conditioned
 *  precisely when the two directions are nearly parallel: its normalized
 *  result is the axis a near-zero perturbation of `segDir` rotates around,
 *  which is hypersensitive to exactly WHICH direction that perturbation
 *  happens to point — two inputs differing only by which axis an
 *  imperceptible (~0.006°) deviation landed on can flip the resulting plane
 *  by 90° (`lineInput.test.ts`'s "playtest-2 review finding C" case) even
 *  though a user would see both as "continuing straight ahead". 1e-2 gives
 *  enough margin over realistic pointer/inference noise to route that case
 *  to the stable view-facing fallback instead, while staying far below any
 *  angle a user could deliberately aim for as a turn. */

 * logic is unit-testable without a Scene fixture.
 *
 * - `prevDir` (the previous segment's direction, normalized — null at the
 *   first segment of a chain, which has no previous segment) spans a plane
 *   with `segDir` when the two are not parallel: `normal = normalize(prevDir
 *   × segDir)`. This keeps an L-shaped chain coplanar, so it can still close

 *   `viewDir` perpendicular to `segDir` (`viewDir` rejected from `segDir`,
 *   normalized) — so the new plane faces the camera rather than receding
 *   edge-on into the screen.
 * - If even THAT degenerates (the camera is aimed almost exactly along the
 *   locked line, so its rejection from `segDir` is ~zero): an arbitrary

 *   a reference axis (a component `segDir` isn't dominantly aligned with),
 *   so the result is always a well-defined unit vector. Neither of the

 * Everything is computed in the plane's own 2D (u, v) coordinates, so the

 * committed before the chain re-homed onto this plane need not be), and

 *   with the line `p + t * axisDir`. Null if the two projected directions
 *   are parallel, or the solved `s` isn't positive.
 * - `lockDir` null (unlocked): the candidate is the foot of the
 *   perpendicular from `cursor` onto the line `p + t * axisDir`.
