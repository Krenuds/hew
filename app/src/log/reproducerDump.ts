/**
 * reproducerDump — the auto-reproducer dump (docs/dev/DEVELOPMENT.md, "the
 * highest-value feature"). On a failure, bundle {recorded command stream so
 * far + serialized .hew + diagnostic-log tail} to disk so "it broke" becomes
 * "here is a model + an input log that reproduces it".
 *
 * Also exports `saveCrashReproducer`, the same bundle assembled on demand
 * from the crash screen's "Save reproducer" button — a Rust panic poisons
 * the wasm instance before the auto-dump above ever runs (every `Scene` call
 * throws afterwards, `take_recording()` included), so it sources `recording`
 * from the panic hook's in-memory capture (./panicCapture.ts) instead.
 *
 * Depends on:
 *   -  recording (docs/dev/DIAGNOSTICS.md): `scene.start_recording()` /
 *     `scene.take_recording()` — the typed Scene command stream.
 *   -  diagnosticLog: `getRecords()` / `toNDJSON()` — the unified
 *     kernel+UI log ring buffer.
 *
 * The registered Scene is the only wasm/Scene access point in this module —
 * everything else (manifest fields, base64, store write) is plain TS, so the
 * module is unit-testable with a fake scene (see reproducerDump.test.ts).
