/**
 * IndexStore — the SQLite logic behind the single `ReportIndex` Durable
 * Object (`reportIndex.ts`), factored out the same way share-relay splits
 * `ShareDrop`/`DropStore`: framework-free, unit-testable under bare
 * `node --test`, with the DO class itself a thin RPC wrapper.
 *
 * Four tables, all tiny (row writes are the free-tier's least generous
 * quota — 100k/day account-wide — so this design opts for a handful of
 * upserted counter rows over one row per event):
 *
 *   - `reports`: one row per report, backing the admin list and the storage
 *     ceiling (`SUM(sizeBytes)`, not a separate counter — deleting a row is
 *     the entire "give the space back" step). A row starts life `committed
 *     = 0` the instant `reserveReport` accepts it — BEFORE a single byte of
 *     the upload has reached its `ReportDrop` — specifically so its size
 *     counts against the ceiling immediately (see "Storage ceiling"
 *     below); `commitReport` flips it to 1 once the upload actually
 *     finishes. `listReports`/the admin-visible half of `getReport` only
 *     ever surface committed rows. `lastActivity` tracks the most recent
 *     piece/start for an uncommitted row — `touchActivity` updates it, and
 *     `findAndDeleteIdleUncommittedIds` is the idle-upload backstop that
 *     reads it (docs/design/report-bug.md §4 "Chunked upload").
 *   - `rate_window`: one row per (clientHash, 10-minute bucket), enforcing
 *     the 5-per-10-minutes limit.
 *   - `rate_day`: one row per clientHash, enforcing the 20-per-day limit.
 *     `clientHash` already changes every UTC day (`clientHash.ts` salts with
 *     the date), so "one row per client per day" falls out for free — the
 *     `day` column exists only so stale rows can be pruned.
 *   - `email_day`: a single counter row per UTC day, enforcing the
 *     account-wide 50-notifications-a-day cap independent of `rate_day`
 *     (many distinct clients each submitting once should not multiply into
 *     many emails).
 *
 * Both rate tables prune expired rows opportunistically on write rather
 * than on a schedule — cheap because both tables stay small, and it avoids
 * giving this DO its own alarm (which would collide with a semantic reading
 * of "the alarm" as retention/abandonment, `ReportDrop`'s job).
