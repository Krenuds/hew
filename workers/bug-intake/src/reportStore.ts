/**
 * ReportStore — the SQLite read/write logic for one report's chunked
 * upload, factored out of the `ReportDrop` Durable Object (`reportDrop.ts`)
 * so it unit-tests under bare `node --test` without importing
 * `cloudflare:workers` — the same split share-relay's `dropStore.ts` makes.
 *
 * Storage shape: a single `meta` row (pinned `id = 0`, the whole upload's
 * state machine) plus `piece(idx, data, length)` rows — ONE row per piece,
 * written exactly once each as it arrives (docs/design/report-bug.md §4
 * "Chunked upload"): no rechunking, no batching, unlike share-relay's
 * `DropStore` or this Worker's own earlier single-request-streaming design.
 * A piece is at most `PIECE_BYTES` (1.9 MB), comfortably under the 2 MB
 * SQLite row/BLOB cap, so it's simply written as one bound parameter.
 *
 * The state machine `startUpload`/`putPiece`/`commit` implement matches
 * §8's wire contract almost one-to-one:
 *
 *   - `startUpload` (from `POST /report/`) writes `meta` with `nextIndex =
 *     1`, stores piece 0, and arms the abandonment alarm.
 *   - `putPiece` (from `PUT /report/<id>/<index>`) accepts the next
 *     expected index (stores it, advances, re-arms the alarm), silently
 *     accepts an identical retry of the last stored index (no double
 *     write), and refuses anything else as out-of-order.
 *   - `commit` (from `POST /report/<id>/commit`) checks every declared byte
 *     arrived, flips `committed`, and re-arms the alarm for RETENTION
 *     instead of abandonment.
 *
 * Every method checks the presented token's hash against the stored one in
 * constant time (`uploadToken.ts`) — this class never sees a raw token,
 * only its SHA-256 hex digest, computed by the caller (`handlers.ts`).
 *
 * Storage is created LAZILY, by `startUpload` alone. A report id is public
 * and a Durable Object is addressed by name, so any request naming a
 * well-formed id that was never started (`PUT`/`commit` with a guessed or
 * stale id, an alarm racing a delete) still instantiates this class over
 * an empty database. If the constructor ran `CREATE TABLE` the way an
 * earlier version did, every such request would leave a few KiB of empty
 * schema behind forever — durable, never alarmed, never cleaned up — and
 * an unauthenticated caller could mint those by the hundred thousand
 * against the account-wide Durable Object storage and daily row-write
 * quotas (shared with share-relay). So every read path first asks
 * `sqlite_master` (a read, which persists nothing) whether `meta` exists
 * and answers "absent" without touching the schema when it doesn't.
