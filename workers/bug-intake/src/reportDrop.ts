/**
 * ReportDrop — the Durable Object that stores one report's chunked upload
 * and, once committed, its finished bytes — one instance per report id
 * (`env.REPORT_DROP.idFromName(id)` in `handlers.ts`), backed by that
 * instance's private SQLite database. Mirrors share-relay's `ShareDrop`
 * wrapper: the actual logic lives in `ReportStore` (`reportStore.ts`,
 * framework-free and unit-tested); this file is the thin runtime wrapper
 * that MUST `extend DurableObject` for its methods to be exposed as RPC at
 * all (a plain class's methods throw Cloudflare error 1101 when called
 * through a stub — see `ShareDrop`'s class doc for the full story of how
 * that bug slips past a mocked unit suite).
 *
 * The alarm serves two different purposes depending on when it fires,
 * because `ReportStore` re-arms it for a different reason at different
 * points (see its doc): ABANDONMENT (`ABANDON_TIMEOUT_MS` after the last
 * piece or the start, while still uncommitted) or RETENTION
 * (`RETENTION_MS` after the upload started, once `commit` has run). Either
 * way, the alarm handler's own job is identical — tell `ReportIndex` to
 * drop the corresponding row, THEN wipe the bytes (see `alarm()`'s own doc
 * for why that order, not the reverse, matters) — which is also how
 * `ReportIndex` computes the storage ceiling (`SUM(sizeBytes)`, not a
 * separate counter — removing the row is the entire "give the space back"
 * step) — so `alarm()` below needs no branch on which case it is.

   *  retry after the index call actually succeeded (but this alarm
   *  invocation died before reaching `destroy()`) is harmless too. Reads
   *  the report id out of its own storage first (this DO's identity is an
   *  opaque hash of the id, not the id itself); a report already deleted
   *  through the admin page (or a prior abandonment) has no `head()` left,
   *  so this is a harmless no-op for it — a stale alarm fire racing an
   *  explicit delete's own `destroy()` (the runtime does not guarantee
   *  `deleteAlarm` beats an already-scheduled invocation) should never
